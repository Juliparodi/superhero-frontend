## üõ°Ô∏è Security

Security is a top priority for this application.

- **JWT Authentication**  
  The frontend obtains a JSON Web Token from the backend during login and attaches it to every API request in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- **HTTPS Only**  
  All API traffic is encrypted end-to-end using SSL/TLS. The backend runs on port **8443** with a valid certificate.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    - **GET** endpoints require authentication and the role `USER` or `READ`.
    - **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE** endpoints require authentication and the role `ADMIN`.
